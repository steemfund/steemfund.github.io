<p>My main motivation to&nbsp;start running a witness&nbsp;was to take part in the ongoing discussion about the future of steemit&nbsp;at what I thought was a critical time. My intention was, and still is, to&nbsp;promote a better distribution of rewards without compromising the stability of the network.</p>
<p>If you are a new to Delegated proof of stake (DPOS) and you are wondering what a witness is I invite you to read this<a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@chitty/the-real-value-of-steemit">&nbsp;post</a>, which outlines the importance of the steemit system and how we can all influence&nbsp;the future of the platfrom.</p>
<p>In this sense, my decision to become a witness is as philosophical as it is technical, I would like to represent my voters in the &ldquo;witness table&rdquo; and help the steemit founders and developers improve the platform for all its existing and future users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also see steemit expanding into different communities and for that we need to promote other languages. I support language tags and I try to always write, read and vote for posts under the <a href="https://steemit.com/trending/spanish">#spanish</a> tag. To help spanish users find and promote their own posts I&nbsp;created @<a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@chitty/introduciendo-steemio-bot-and-twitter">steemiobot</a> twitter account and telegram channel, @steemiobot automatically broadcasts all the posts published with the <a href="https://steemit.com/trending/spanish">#spanish</a> tag.</p>
<p>I am also a long time supporter of the Venezuelan community on Steemit. It is my believe that Steemit can really make a difference on third world countries. I have carried out Facebook campaigns to attract more venezuelans to steemit.com, I also vote and promote the venezuelan trail of @provenezuela and I have created the Venezuelan chainbb sub-forum:&nbsp;<a href="http://chainbb.com/f/venezuela" rel="noopener">chainbb.com/f/venezuela</a></p>
